# symbol-table
A symbol-table is a data structure maintained by compilers in order to store information about the occurrence of various entities such as identifiers, objects, function names etc.
Information of different entities may include type, value, scope etc.

This implementation of symbol table is not what an actual modern compiler uses today but it may give you a first impression of how a compiler maintains symbol informations.
